    "## An econometric analysis of Engel curves for Canadian households\n",

    "you know from Micro A, Engel curves describe how demand for individual products or a\n",

    "You can get an overview of the data by calling the variable you assigned the DataFrame to. If you named the variable `df`, you simply run the command `df` to get an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few basic Pandas tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To see the names of the variables in the dataframe, you can run `df.columns`\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get the dimensions of a DataFrame, you can use `df.shape`\n",
    "\n",
    "- To access a specific column (for example, the _xalc_ column), you can either use `df['xalc']` or `df.xalc`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a view of the DataFrame where you only see a list of specific variables, you can index the DataFrame using a list of labels. For example, to create a view that only shows the alcohol, tobacco and recreation expenditures, you can use the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "vars = ['xalc', 'xtob', 'xrecr']\n",
    "df[vars]\n",
    "```\n",
    "or alternatively the one-liner:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "df[['xalc', 'xtob', 'xrecr']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also index the DataFrame based on conditional logic. This is basically the same thing as using a filter in Excel. For example, if I want to only see the households where tobacco consumption is greater than 500, I would use the code:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "I = df.xtob > 500\n",
    "df[I]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line above creates a boolean vector `I` that is True or False for each household depending on whether their tobacco consumption is greater than 500 or not. In the second line, I use this vector to 'filter' the DataFrame so only the households satisfying the condition show up in the resulting view.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be done in a one-liner:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "df[df.xtob > 500]\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is possible to combine multiple 'filters':\n",
    "```py\n",
    "df[(df.xtob > 500) & (df.xalc < 1000)]\n",

If for example we want to compute descriptive statistics for only the alcohol, tobacco and recreation expenditure variables, you can use the code:\n",
